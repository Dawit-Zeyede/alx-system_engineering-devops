Configuration management makes it trivial to replicate environments with the exact same software and configurations. This enables you to effectively build a multistage ecosystem, with production, development, and testing servers. You can even use local virtual machines for development, built with the same provisioning scripts. This practice will minimize problems caused by environment discrepancies that frequently occur when applications are deployed to production or shared between co-workers with different machine setups (different operating system, software versions and/or configurations).
